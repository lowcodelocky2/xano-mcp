# Workspaces Tools

This directory is reserved for future implementation of tools for managing Xano workspaces.

## Planned Features

- List workspaces
- Get workspace details
- Create workspace
- Update workspace
- Delete workspace

## Implementation Status

These tools are not yet implemented. The current implementation uses a single workspace specified by the XANO_WORKSPACE environment variable. Check back in future versions for multi-workspace support.
